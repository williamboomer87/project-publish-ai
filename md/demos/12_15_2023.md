# Client Feedback
These changes need to be updated by end of the week. Once the edits are done, let’s start creating each component of this pipeline (book cover generation, book outline creation, chapter transcription, grammar and spell checking, and tone creation)  as a separate API to be hosted on AWS. That way, we can deploy each component of the system separately.  Once the APIs are created, send me the documentation.
